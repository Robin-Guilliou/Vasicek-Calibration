# Vasicek-Calibration

The Vasicek model describes the evolution of interest rates. Under the model, the instantaneous interest rate follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process.

The notebook provides a description of the Vasicek model. First, the stochastic differential equation (SDE) is solved. Then, interest rates paths are generated using Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the model is calibrated using the least squares method and the maximum likelihood method.
